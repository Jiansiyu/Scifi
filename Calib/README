Quick desciption of what's in folders:

Tyler_calib: has calorimeter calibration scripts for the LHRS and RHRS. Has nice diagrams of both detectors as well.

MikeShower: has RHRS shower calib but older and less useful (only ADC_check.C might be worth looking at).

hanjie: has calibration of Chernkov, scinitllators, raster, VDC and time
	- should be looked over comprehensivley

batch_ped_scan: scans ADCs for changes in pedestal over time
