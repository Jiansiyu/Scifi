Small notes on how analyzer works:

     
     To get FadcModule250 loaded in set-up process:

     THaEvData->Init() (called by THaAnalyzer->Init or THaRun)
     calls THaEvData->init_cmap()
     calls cratemap->Init() (fMap member of THaEvData)
     calls THaCratemap::SetModule()
     calls THaCratemap::SetModelSize()
     -----> this function recognizes 250 as parameter for fadc250
     	    gives info about no of channels and amount fo data


  
     Also:
     
     THaEvData has crateslot member variable: a vector of THaSlotData
     int THaEvData::makeidx( ) 
     	 crateslot[i]->loadModule(fMap);
     	 loads in module type based on fMap (cratemap)
	 stores this in fModule member variable
	 hence THaEvData has access to fadc250 module class
     makeidx() calles by THaEvData::init_slotdata();
     init_slotdata() called by THaEvData::Init()
